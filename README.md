## ‚û°Ô∏è Get started

This toolkit works with Python versions 3.8 and up.

Install the package with:

    pip install stroke-lifetime

And follow the link to the code demonstration in the "External resources" section below. 

## üè• Motivation in brief:

Given values for a patient's age, sex, and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score on discharge from hospital following a stroke, we can calculate the following quantities across the remainder of that patient's lifespan:
+ The probability of survival of the patient in each year.
+ The number of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).
+ The expected use of resources (e.g. number of admissions to A&E and number of years spent in residential care) and the cost of those resources.
+ The discounted total net benefit by change in mRS score. 

The model is described in _a paper that's not yet published. Link will be added when available_.


## üì¶ Package details:

There are three main modules in the package:

+ `models.py` - Basic models.
+ `fixed_params.py` - Constants.
+ `main_calculations.py` - Gathers the basic models and calculates all of the useful outputs.

## üìö External resources

The following resources are not included within the package files and are accessible on the GitHub repository.

A conda environment file, `environment.yml`, is provided in the GitHub repository for use with the demonstration Jupyter notebook.

+ [![Jupyter Notebook][jupyternotebook-img]][demo-jupyternotebook-link] - [Code demonstration][demo-jupyternotebook-link] of running the main function and using the results. It also contains reference tables to describe the results categories.
